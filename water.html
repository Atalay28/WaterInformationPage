            Welcome to my tribute page about water.<br />
            In this tribute page you will get knowledge about water and it's
            effect on our world, on humankind and on humankind history.<br />
            I assume you already know that water is most important thing for
            life forms including us. So I will skip the parts of why we should
            save it and not waste it. My purpose of making this website is make
            you more careful about using water and get you to know about water
            that you consume everyday. If you enjoy reading this information
            don't forget to share with your friends and make them more careful
            and knowledgeable about water.

            Before humans got settled down they drink water from stanks, lakes,
            waterfalls, rivulets and rivers. That's not the best option always
            they often get sick and die because of water's pollution. Water get
            polluted because humans and animals excrement blend in to them and
            made it toxic. After humans got settled down they tried to keep
            cloose to the water source and keep it clean so they don't get sick.
            After settling down they notice that water is very important for
            crops. So they wanted more water because more water means more crops
            and more crops means more wealth and more wealth means more triumph
            but they didn't always got what they wanted because when they are
            fighting the defeated side often polute the water and poison the
            soil. So humans needed to get water without fighting and that's
            get's us the aqueducts they built aqueducts to transport the clean
            water to where they wanted it. After humans technology is improved
            they wanted to make water more accesible. They built factories for
            bottling water. But it didn't always enough for humans because we
            are too many nowadays. So they started to filter the seawater and
            drink it. That's our water adventure for now but in future more
            interesting things is waiting us.

            The water molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms, each linked by
            a single chemical bond to an oxygen atom. Although its formula (H2O)
            seems simple, water exhibits very complex chemical and physical
            properties. For example, its melting point, 0 °C (32 °F), and
            boiling point, 100 °C (212 °F), are much higher than would be
            expected by comparison with analogous compounds. In its solid form,
            ice, water is less dense than when it is liquid, another unusual
            property. The root of these anomalies lies in the electronic
            structure of the water molecule.The water molecule is not linear but
            bent in a special way. The two hydrogen atoms are bound to the
            oxygen atom at an angle of 104.5°. Because an oxygen atom has a
            greater electronegativity than a hydrogen atom, the O―H bonds in the
            water molecule are polar, with the oxygen bearing a partial negative
            charge (δ−) and the hydrogens having a partial positive charge (δ+).
            Hydrogen atoms in water molecules are attracted to regions of high
            electron density and can form weak linkages, called hydrogen bonds,
            with those regions. This means that the hydrogen atoms in one water
            molecule are attracted to the nonbonding electron pairs of the
            oxygen atom on an adjacent water molecule. The structure of liquid
            water is believed to consist of aggregates of water molecules that
            form and re-form continually. This short-range order, as it is
            called, accounts for other unusual properties of water, such as its
            high viscosity and surface tension. Water undergoes various types of
            chemical reactions. One of the most important chemical properties of
            water is its ability to behave as both an acid (a proton donor) and
            a base (a proton acceptor), the characteristic property of
            amphoteric substances.This behaviour is most clearly seen in the
            autoionization of water. When an active metal such as sodium is
            placed in contact with liquid water, a violent exothermic
            (heat-producing) reaction occurs that releases flaming hydrogen gas.

            Throughout history, healers around the world have recognized the
            therapeutic effects of water. The Greeks sought natural springs and
            baths to restore the mind and body, while the Japanese practiced
            misogi, an ancient water cleansing ritual that persists today.
            Modern research shows that our ancestors were onto something. A
            growing body of evidence supports the claim that blue spaces are
            good for our mental wellness. It’s hard to describe why it happens,
            but being around water gives us a sense of awe and lets us feel like
            we’re part of something bigger than ourselves. If even for a moment,
            this discourages strict self-interest, instead promoting outward
            thinking and prosocial behaviors. It also helps to improve empathy,
            humility and overall life satisfaction. The five senses are
            critically important to how we perceive the world. That’s why the
            sensory effects of water can have such an impact on our psyche. The
            sights, sounds and smell of water provide a calming experience that
            promotes a uniquely positive state of mind. And if the salty sea air
            or lapping waves remind you of something familiar, such as spending
            time at the beach as a child, it can trigger happy, vivid memories.
            If you’re spending more time near water, you might be encouraged to
            engage with it physically by swimming, floating or diving. This is
            good for your mental and physical health, which are closely
            connected. In fact, swimming is one of the best ways to work out the
            entire body, helping to build endurance, strengthen your muscles and
            keep your heart rate up. Studies have found that even a mild
            increase in water intake has a significant impact on restoring water
            balance. Water intake also plays a huge role in fertility in both
            men and women. And there are already enough studies to show that
            individuals with fertility problems are likely to be battling
            depression and have difficulty sleeping. Research has shown that
            water can have a direct effect on the brain’s activity. The sight
            and sound of water are processed by the brain in ways that induce a
            naturally meditative state, which can lead to improved brain
            function concerning creativity and problem-solving abilities.
            Studies using brain imaging have shown that being near water can
            reduce blood flow to the brain’s prefrontal cortex, which manages
            the brain’s planning and executive functions. This reduction allows
            the brain to enter a more restful state, freeing mental resources
            for more creative and reflective thinking.
