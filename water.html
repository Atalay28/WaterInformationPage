              Water is the most basic and important element of human history.
              Before settled life, water consumption styles changed with nomadic
              lifestyles. Water resources were critical for those engaged in
              hunting and gathering. Humans used lakes, rivers, and other water
              sources for their daily needs. Water was generally used directly
              from its source; there was no sterilization. Nomadic communities
              were always on the move in search of water resources and were
              generally more careful about finding clean water sources. In those
              eras, water's sterility and reliability had a direct effect on
              human health. Humans typically used water for drinking, food
              preparation, and personal hygiene. Settling down brought
              significant changes to water usage. With the agricultural
              revolution, the need to manage and store water emerged. Humans
              developed systems for controlling water resources, and water
              became a critical factor for successful farming. In this era, they
              built water channels and ponds for water storage. Additionally,
              settled life necessitated the protection of water quality.
              Ensuring clean water was important for the health of communities.
              Therefore, some basic sterilization methods, especially simple
              techniques such as using sunlight, became widespread over time for
              better management and purification of water. Sedentary societies
              developed various methods to ensure the delivery and sterilization
              of water. Water was usually stored in portable containers and
              carried into homes for use. In ancient times, various natural
              methods were used to purify water. For example, boiling water was
              an effective method for killing bacteria. Additionally, adding
              herbal substances to water helped in purification. With the
              development of technologies, water sterilization became more
              systematic. During the Roman Empire, large aqueduct systems were
              built to transmit water, ensuring clean water delivery to various
              parts of the cities. In the Middle Ages, various filtering methods
              and the use of activated charcoal to purify water became
              widespread. Water played a critical role in the development of
              human societies both before and after the transition to settled
              life. With this transition, water management, communication, and
              sterilization gained importance, significantly increasing the
              health and welfare levels of societies. Water is an indispensable
              element not only for life but also for the construction of
              civilization.

          <h3>Chemical Information</h3>
          <article>
            <p>
              The water molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms, each linked
              by a single chemical bond to an oxygen atom. Although its formula
              (H2O) seems simple, water exhibits very complex chemical and
              physical properties. For example, its melting point, 0 °C (32 °F),
              and boiling point, 100 °C (212 °F), are much higher than would be
              expected by comparison with analogous compounds. In its solid
              form, ice, water is less dense than when it is liquid, another
              unusual property. The root of these anomalies lies in the
              electronic structure of the water molecule.The water molecule is
              not linear but bent in a special way. The two hydrogen atoms are
              bound to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.5°. Because an oxygen
              atom has a greater electronegativity than a hydrogen atom, the O―H
              bonds in the water molecule are polar, with the oxygen bearing a
              partial negative charge (δ−) and the hydrogens having a partial
              positive charge (δ+). Hydrogen atoms in water molecules are
              attracted to regions of high electron density and can form weak
              linkages, called hydrogen bonds, with those regions. This means
              that the hydrogen atoms in one water molecule are attracted to the
              nonbonding electron pairs of the oxygen atom on an adjacent water
              molecule. The structure of liquid water is believed to consist of
              aggregates of water molecules that form and re-form continually.
              This short-range order, as it is called, accounts for other
              unusual properties of water, such as its high viscosity and
              surface tension. Water undergoes various types of chemical
              reactions. One of the most important chemical properties of water
              is its ability to behave as both an acid (a proton donor) and a
              base (a proton acceptor), the characteristic property of
              amphoteric substances.This behaviour is most clearly seen in the
              autoionization of water. When an active metal such as sodium is
              placed in contact with liquid water, a violent exothermic
              (heat-producing) reaction occurs that releases flaming hydrogen
              gas.

              Throughout history, healers around the world have recognized the
              therapeutic effects of water. The Greeks sought natural springs
              and baths to restore the mind and body, while the Japanese
              practiced misogi, an ancient water cleansing ritual that persists
              today. Modern research shows that our ancestors were onto
              something. A growing body of evidence supports the claim that blue
              spaces are good for our mental wellness. It’s hard to describe why
              it happens, but being around water gives us a sense of awe and
              lets us feel like we’re part of something bigger than ourselves.
              If even for a moment, this discourages strict self-interest,
              instead promoting outward thinking and prosocial behaviors. It
              also helps to improve empathy, humility and overall life
              satisfaction. The five senses are critically important to how we
              perceive the world. That’s why the sensory effects of water can
              have such an impact on our psyche. The sights, sounds and smell of
              water provide a calming experience that promotes a uniquely
              positive state of mind. And if the salty sea air or lapping waves
              remind you of something familiar, such as spending time at the
              beach as a child, it can trigger happy, vivid memories. If you’re
              spending more time near water, you might be encouraged to engage
              with it physically by swimming, floating or diving. This is good
              for your mental and physical health, which are closely connected.
              In fact, swimming is one of the best ways to work out the entire
              body, helping to build endurance, strengthen your muscles and keep
              your heart rate up. Studies have found that even a mild increase
              in water intake has a significant impact on restoring water
              balance. Water intake also plays a huge role in fertility in both
              men and women. And there are already enough studies to show that
              individuals with fertility problems are likely to be battling
              depression and have difficulty sleeping. Research has shown that
              water can have a direct effect on the brain’s activity. The sight
              and sound of water are processed by the brain in ways that induce
              a naturally meditative state, which can lead to improved brain
              function concerning creativity and problem-solving abilities.
              Studies using brain imaging have shown that being near water can
              reduce blood flow to the brain’s prefrontal cortex, which manages
              the brain’s planning and executive functions. This reduction
              allows the brain to enter a more restful state, freeing mental
              resources for more creative and reflective thinking.
