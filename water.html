            Before humans got settled down they drink water from stanks, lakes, waterfalls, rivulets and rivers. That's not the best option always they often get sick and die because of water's pollution.
            Water get polluted because humans and animals excrement blend in to them and made it toxic. After humans got settled down they tried to keep cloose to the  water source and keep it clean so they don't get sick.
            After settling down they notice that water is very important for crops. So they wanted more water because more water means more crops and more crops means more wealth and more wealth means
            more triumph but they didn't always got what they wanted because when they are fighting the defeated side often polute the water and poison the soil. So humans needed to get water without fighting
            and that's get's us the aqueducts they built aqueducts to transport the clean water to where they wanted it. After humans technology is improved they wanted to make water more accesible.
            They built factories for bottling water. But it didn't always enough for humans because we are too many nowadays. So they started to filter the seawater and drink it. 
            That's our water adventure for now but in future more interesting things is waiting us.
